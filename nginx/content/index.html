  <h3 id="Purpose">Purpose</h3>
  <p>The main purpose of this website is to provide an information and tips to people interested in HAHS. It's also my website which I paid good money for so it's also a hotbed for whatever I want.</p>

  <h2 id="Grades">Grades</h2>
  <h3 id="Year-7">Year 7</h3>
  <p>The first year of high school is always a strange one. Just recently you were the top dog and now you're definitely not. To be honest year 7 really doesn't matter too much so try to build up some character and talk to people. You will be with your cohort for the next 6 years of your life so make it count. Week 3 or 4 will probably be the first time you've seen an assessment that actually looks important. As is tradition you will forget about it and open up Google Doc 6 hours before it's due and smash out 200 words an hour. You tell yourself this will never happen again. That's a lie because it happens again and again anyway.</p>

  <h3 id="Year-8">Year 8</h3>
  <p>Year 8 brings a few new choices but it's basically the same as year 7 except with Japanese. If you haven't noticed by now every 2 years you get new opportunities. These are called stages and you're in 4. I'd say the most important part of stage 4 is choosing your electives. You get to choose a minor and 2 majors except one of those majors is mandatory Agriculture. Extremely popular options include PASS, Commerce, and Engineering. If you get the choice pick the subject you think you'll enjoy. You're parents are probably bias anyway.</p>

  <h3 id="Year-9">Year 9</h3>
  <p>Away go Visual Arts, TAS, Music, and Japanese and in comes your electives and Agriculture. If you've chosen wisely you'll have a content and happy year 9. If you're like the rest of us low-lifes you will regret your decision and/or hate enforced Agriculture. No joke there used to be a small movement trying to allow year 8 to chose 2 majors. <a href="https://www.change.org/p/hurlstone-agricultural-high-school-make-hahs-year-8-get-2-majors">This petition</a> was really a thing. However it goes, now's the time to test the waters with electives and see what subjects you enjoy.</p>

  <h3 id="Year-10">Year 10</h3>
  <p>The last bludging year. Some claim that's year 9 but they're wrong. Technically if you decide to leave school early than you probably should start focusing. At the end of year 10 you will have a ROSA and will be legally allowed to leave school. If you go to Hurlstone you're probably not dropping out are you.</p>

  <h3 id="Year-11">Year 11</h3>
  <p>This is the first year were what you do matters. Honestly this is a pretty good time to start hunkering. If you do chemistry as an elective here are some useful links below. You'll need to request access though.</p>

  <h3 id="Year-12">Year 12</h3>
  <p>IDK. If by year 12 you still need guidance from of all places an unofficial school website written by someone who barely knows HTML there might be a problem. Study well and take breaks every so often so you don't burn out.</p>
